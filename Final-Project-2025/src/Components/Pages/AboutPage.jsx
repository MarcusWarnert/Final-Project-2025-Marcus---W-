                    This app took life one day when I was chatting with my wife about movies.  Always watching movies together, we are constantly wondering where we can watch certain movies.  So then we have to go through the process of checking each streaming app we have access to and see if it's free there.  Then we eventually find it, only to find out that it isn't even free.  So then we return to old faithful, Hallmark Movies and Mysteries.  Defeated.
                    Then my wife was like, "Why don't you make an app that tells you where a movie is free to stream?"
                    And here we are.  Look up a movie, save it to your wishlist, and you can easily see if and where it is free to stream!
